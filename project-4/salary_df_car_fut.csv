The roles offered are related to investigation, implementation, and analysis for a new research project awarded by the International Design Centre Singapore, initially a two-year program. Project Description This project focuses on if data-visualisation for use in a design context, could be best tackled from a 'decision first' point of view. Developing design approaches and tools for industry which support the act of decision making. This is in contrast to a 'data first' approach where the visualisations used are dictated by the most appropriate way to show the data but what is done with that data is ignored. The hypnosis is that actionable data-visualisation is inherently different and requires research to improve it as well as new interaction platforms to support good approaches. The research is interdisciplinary anchored in Architecture, Structural Engineering and Geography/Planning domains by, Sam Joyce [SUTD] (principal investigator), Caitlin Muller [MIT], and Ate Poorthuis [SUTD] respectively all with industry, software and research experience. The spatial, visual, analytical and subjective nature of these disciplines makes them uniquely interesting when considering how design decisions are made. Typically, with buildings, masterplans, and government initiatives there are a complex set of stakeholders with executive power. This project aims to research and consider what types of visualisations are required to provide the best insight to help these people make these decisions.   Job Description We are keen to take on someone who is enthusiastic about design and data visualisation. The role aims to give a motivated self-starter the space and support to explore new concepts systems and implantations, guided within a group of domain experts with strong academic and industrial backgrounds.

Ideally this would include both frontend with experience in relevant dynamic frameworks, also back end specifically node.js servers and basic MongoDB interop. Experimental data analytics, visualisation and modelling. The project will be conducting interactive experiments on a wide range of already committed industry leaders, design students, and the general public via interactive platforms to gain first hand data to provide insights into the process. The role will involve design and implementation of the experiments and subsequent analysis and exposition. Ensuring analytics rigor but also uncovering trends and relationships. Development of webserver services to aid designers on decision making based on the recommendations in the initial research. This may involve a full user system but also a web framework to help designers easily implement these approaches into their workflows.  The job will be based in SUTD, with planned exchanges and openings to visit to work at MIT. Project researchers from MIT will visit and work collaboratively at SUTD. Furthermore, opportunities will be made to present and share the work at conferences based on research outcomes.","RequirementsDomain Background  Data-Scientist / Web-developer /Engineer / Architect / Geographer    Education  Holds a degree/masters/PhD in one of the above fields.    Skills     Keen design sense or willingness to learn Interest or understating of the professional design and creative process Experience in programming visually attractive projects    Required Proficiency  Python &/or JavaScript Understanding of web    Desired Proficiency  Data science / Analytics D3.js  &/or Node.js experience 3D modelling 	 WebGL / three.js / Rhino/ Grasshopper / Dynamo   Photoshop / Creative Suite    Job Details  Competitive salary One-year contract with strong potential to extend (the current project is 2 years) The role is based primarily in SUTD Singapore Directly responsible to Sam Joyce    Benefits  Health Insurance Support for publication & open source projects.

The platform is an open public-private one with government playing the role of a neutral and trusted data-broker to multilateralise data-sharing for health innovation and service delivery. This project has the ambition to create a step-improvement in health promotion and chronic disease management, pioneering capabilities with tech giants to front global-first co-innovation. It will also allow for the real time tracking of the Singapore population's health behaviours, and potentially give Government a much more accurate read of how the population responds to policy changes and allow for personalised services delivered at national scale.  By providing a research platform for new medical interventions, it has the potential to accelerate the adoption of a whole range of clinical interventions.  The project will involve a range private sector players coming in to use Singapore as a test bed to trial new products and services in precision health and medicine.  Key technologies that are likely to be trialled in this project are health related wearable and sensor technology, big data analytics, machine learning, behavioural science, genomics and precision medicine.      The Strategy and Industry Lead will assist the Coordinating Director to:    Strategise, plan and formulate the vision, implementation strategy and roadmap (including workstreams, team structures, timelines and budgets) for TeNHP; Reach out, assess, prioritise and implement key partnerships with private sector leaders in technology and healthcare sector to participate on our platform. This includes rallying and coordinating action from MOH and WOG implementation agencies and stakeholders (HPB, IHIS, Regional Hospital Systems, Govtech, SNPO, A*STAR, EDB, universities and research institutes), cutting through red tape to move quickly on joint industry engagement on all health technology matters; Manage, assess and report on overall project progress (business, technology, industry, policy, comms/marketing etc.), manage inter-dependencies and key project risks, and suggest adjustments to strategy and implementation plan to maximise value optimisation.
